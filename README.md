# Massively Parallel Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains two assignments from "Massively Parallel Machine Learning": Logistic Regression and K-Means Clustering. Both are implemented using Spark with Python and are accompanied by detailed reports.

### Parallel Logistic Regression
- **Objective**: Implement a parallel version of logistic regression for botnet detection.
- **Key Features**:
  - Functions for reading, normalizing data, training, and accuracy computation.
  - Application of gradient descent and regularization.
  - Evaluation of parallelization effects on performance and speed.

### Parallel K-Means Clustering
- **Objective**: Implement and evaluate a parallel version of the K-Means algorithm.
- **Key Features**:
  - Serialized and parallelized implementations of K-Means on the MNIST dataset.
  - Analysis of execution time and the impact of parallelism.
  - Performance and speedup curves, and interpretation of clusters.
